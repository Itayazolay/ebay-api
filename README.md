# ebay-api
Ebay API client implementation to make ebay great again.
One of my problems when handling existing ebay api clients is that it handles
the requests for you, and I needed to handle them myself using aiohttp or
scrapy requests.
This API helps you build and parse the api requests to ebay, but let you handle
the networking yourself.
